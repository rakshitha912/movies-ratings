This task involves creating a model to predict a movie's rating based on features such
as genre, director, and actors. Using regression techniques, the aim is to analyze
historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating
assigned by users or critics. This project will require you to apply data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning skills to explore how
different factors influence movie ratings. Dataset
